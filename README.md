## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to add fonts from files in CSS. By using the @font-face rule, I can define custom fonts, specifying the
src
attribute with the path to the font files. Here's an example:

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: "Fraunces";
  src: url("../assets/fonts/fraunces/fraunces-semi-bold.ttf") format("truetype");
  font-style: normal;
}
```
